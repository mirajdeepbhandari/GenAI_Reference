It was Annapurna I, and although countless at -\\ntempts had been made on Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in the \\nworld, no expedition had succeeded until then. These mountains \\nare known as the eight-thousanders and all fourteen of them lie \\nin Asia. Of the fourteen, Nepal has a big share of eight. They are \\nMt. Everest (8,848m), Kanchenjunga (8,586m), Lhotse (8516m), \\nMakalu (8,463m), Cho Oyu (8201m), Dhaulagiri (8167m), Manaslu \\n(8,163m), and Annapurna I (8,091m). These lofty peaks are part \\nof the Himalaya (The Abode of the Snows, Him= snow, alaya= \\ndwelling place.) and form a natural boundary wall between Nepal \\nand Tibet/China in the north and between India and Nepal in the \\neast. The highest peak outside Asia is the Aconcagua (6,959m) of \\nthe Andes in Peru, South America and the highest mountain in \\nPhewa lake with annapurna rangeHimalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n56Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n6Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\nEurope, Mt. Elbrus is significantly smaller, \\nrising no higher than 5,643m.\\nIt is believed the Himalaya was formed \\naround 50 million years ago and that, \\nin geological time is considered recent, \\nwhich is why this gigantic chain of \\nmountains is called the youngest in the \\nworld. These mountains are still rising. It \\nis also known that the region occupied \\nby the Himalayan range today, was once \\na shallow T ethys sea. Countless fossils of \\nmollusks are found even today proving \\nthe point. Gigantic forces moved the \\nIndo-Australian Plate against the Eur -\\nasian continental Plate causing the land \\nto fold upwards creating a massive chain \\nof mountains over millions of years. The \\nHimalaya stretches 2,400 km across east \\nto west.\\nFour of the other eight-thousanders \\nare in Pakistan while one lies in China. \\nEight-thousanders are the ultimate chal -\\nlenge for any mountaineer. They have \\nfascinated the avid climber who is always \\non the lookout for fresh challenges. A \\ntowering figure among all the climbers \\nis the Tyrolean champion mountaineer, \\nReinhold Messner. He took mountain \\nclimbing to new heights when along \\nwith Peter Habelar he climbed Everest \\nwithout the aid of bottled oxygen. This \\nfeat had previously been deemed too \\ndangerous. While Habelar disappeared \\nfrom the limelight, Messner went on to \\naccomplish a solo climb of Everest and then astounded the world by climbing all \\neight-thousanders. Inspired by the great \\nman, others followed in his footsteps and \\nthere are mountaineers still in the quest \\nof achieving this great feat.\\nThe zone above 8000m is called the \\nDeath Zone as many have perished in \\nthe thin cold air that taxes the body to \\nits limits. Doubts were raised before the \\nconquest of Everest whether man could \\nsurvive at such dizzying heights. But the \\nBritish had been attempting to climb \\nthe world’s highest peak from the early \\n1920s via Tibet. Many perished in the \\nattempt. Nepal had firmly shut its doors \\nto outsiders, hence all expeditions took \\nthe longer and more demanding route \\nvia Tibet, but none were successful. How -\\never, in the early 1950s, Nepal opened \\nits doors to the outside world and there \\nwas a mad rush to climb from the south. \\nA few expeditions were permitted each \\nyear and it was only in May 1953 that \\nEdmund Hillary and T enzing Norgay \\nreached the top of Everest becoming the \\nfirst humans to do so. The French who \\nconquered the first eight-thousander \\nseemed to have set the ball rolling for \\nthe rest of the world to try and be the \\nfirst to climb a virgin eight-thousander. \\nThe mountaineers were surprisingly \\nsuccessful during the 1950s and this'), Document(page_content='was a mad rush to climb from the south. \\nA few expeditions were permitted each \\nyear and it was only in May 1953 that \\nEdmund Hillary and T enzing Norgay \\nreached the top of Everest becoming the \\nfirst humans to do so.

All but \\ntwo of the fourteen eight-thousanders \\nwere climbed during the 1950s.Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n7\\nEver since the highest peak in the world was identified by an  \\nemployee of the Geological Survey of India in 1852, the moun -\\ntain has fascinated and drawn climbers from around the world. \\nKnown simply as Peak XV when the historic discovery was made, \\nit was eventually named ‘Everest’ by the then Surveyor General, \\nAndrew Waugh in honour of his predecessor, George Everest.\\nThe Tibetans and Sherpas (who lived close to the mountain) \\nknew it as Chhomolungma and the Nepalese Government later \\ngave it the name ‘Sagarmatha’. The early climbers like the famous \\nduo, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine attempted to climb \\nfrom the Tibetan side which lies on the northern side of Everest. Mt.Everest (8,848m, Sagarmatha \\nin Nepali): The highest mountain \\nin the world\\nLatitude: 27° 59 ’ 17 ” N, Longitude: 86° 55 ’ 31 ” EHimalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n78Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n8Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\nThe first British Everest Reconnaissance \\nExpedition to the mountain was led by \\nLt. Colonel Charles Howard-Bury and \\nGeorge Mallory was part of the team.  \\nThe northern and eastern reaches of \\nthe mountain were explored and on \\n24th September 1921, Guy Bullock along \\nwith Mallory became the first climbers \\nto reach a height of 7000m on Everest. \\nThey had climbed to the north Col of \\nthe mountain establishing the northern \\nroute. Nepal being completely cut off \\nfrom the rest of the world (except for a \\nfew invited guests), no attempts could be \\nmade from the south. In Tibet, the Dalai \\nLama of the time had given permission to \\nthe foreigners to climb even though he \\nwondered why they wanted to do such a \\nsenseless thing. T o Asians it made no sense \\nat all; risking one’s life to reach the top of \\na mountain that is covered in snow under \\nbitterly cold conditions.\\nMt. Everest lies in the Khumbu region \\nof Nepal on the northern border \\nwith Tibet and also falls within the \\nSagarmatha National Park. After many \\nattempts had been made on the moun -\\ntain, it was T enzing Norgay and Edmund \\nHillary who finally proved to the world \\nthat it could be climbed. At 9:30am on \\na sunny morning of 29th May 1953, the \\nNew Zealander and the Sherpa Sirdar \\nstood triumphantly atop the highest \\nmountain in the world. While T enzing \\nstood on the summit with a collection \\nof flags, Hillary took his picture, which \\ngraced the front pages of newspapers around the world. It was a great mo -\\nment in history not only for the two \\nclimbers but for mankind in general. \\nBefore the epic climb there had been \\nmuch speculation as doubts were \\nraised if man could survive at such \\ngreat altitudes. The previous year, T enz -\\ning had almost reached the top with \\nSwiss climber Raymond Lambert, but it \\nwas the British expedition led by John \\nHunt that got the eventual honours. \\nWay back in 1924, Mallory and Irvine \\nhad disappeared after they were last \\nseen 240m below the summit. Although \\nMallory’s well preserved body was \\nfound high up on the mountain in 1999, \\nnobody is really sure if the duo made it \\nto the summit or died on the way up.\\nSince 1953, many records have been \\nbroken and many sherpas have climbed \\nmore than ten times each. The record \\nholder Apa Sherpa has climbed the peak \\nan astounding eighteen times. Many \\ntoday climb to set a new record such as \\nthe speed record. Others have climbed \\nto become the youngest or the oldest. \\nA blind man made it to the top and so \\ndid an amputee. With modern gear and \\nsherpas to guide them, climbing has be -\\ncome so much simpler than in the early \\ndays when nobody knew which way to go \\nor even if it was possible to summit. The \\nmost common way up to the summit is \\nthe southeast ridge route.Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n9\\nThere was a time when Mt. Kanchenjunga was considered the \\nhighest mountain in the world. This was before the startling \\ndiscovery made by the Chief Computer (today they are replaced \\nby machines) who pointed out that Peak XV was in fact higher \\nthan Peak IX, Kanchenjunga. Later it became apparent that Peak \\nIX was actually only the third highest mountain after Everest \\nand K2 (Karakoram, Pakistan). It lies 128 km east of Everest.

The first to go \\nup the Yalung glacier was Alaister Crowley \\nbut he lost four men on the mountain; a \\nLieutenant Pache and three porters. For \\nfifteen years, no one dared another attempt. \\nIn 1929, an American climber named Francis \\nFarmer left behind his porters and climbed \\nup the south face but was never seen again. \\nThen Paul Bauer led a Bavarian expedition \\nup the mountain later in the same year and \\nreached the altitude of 7,700m. Following an \\nunsuccessful attempt by Gunther Dyhren -\\nfurth in 1930, Bauer made a second attempt \\nin 1931. Hans Hartman and Dr. Karl Wien \\nreached 7,990m before they were forced \\nto turn back. \\nWith the outbreak of the Second World -\\nWar, there was no climbing in the Himalayas. The next attempt was made by Gilmour \\nLewis and George Frey in 1951 looking for \\nan easier route to the top. He failed and \\nreturned two years later with John Kempe \\nbut met with no success. He returned once \\nagain in 1954 with a new team of climbers \\nbut luck was not on his side. \\nFifty years after the first attempt, in \\n1955, a British expedition took off, led by \\nCharles Evans, who had been a member \\nof the successful expedition on Everest \\ntwo years earlier. T wo Britons, George \\nBand and Joe Brown finally made it to the \\nsummit of this difficult mountain. Given \\nthe fact that the Sikkimese considered \\nthe mountain very sacred, the summiteers \\nrefrained from stepping right up to the \\ntop. They stopped five vertical feet below \\nthe summit on 25th May. Finally, Kanchen -\\njunga, the third highest mountain in the \\nworld had been conquered. The first \\nNepali to climb this peak was Ang Phurba \\nSherpa on 14th May 1980.Himalayan Peaks of Nepal\\n11\\nMt. Lhotse is connected to Everest via the South Col and is \\nthe fourth highest mountain in the world. The main summit \\nis 8,516 m while Lhotse Middle (East) is 8,414 metres and Lhotse \\nShar is 8,383 metres. Very often, climbers making an attempt on \\nEverest, go up the Lhotse to acclimatize. In fact, the usual route \\nleading to Everest starts up the northwest face of Lhotse and then \\ncuts across to the more famous mountain. \\nAn early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International \\nHimalayan Expedition. It was led by Norman Dyhrenfurth and \\nalso included two Austrians, Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn \\nas well as two Swiss climbers, Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel. \\nIt was also the first expedition in the Everest area to include \\nAmericans:Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan.

Captain William Webb who came in 1809 was the \\nfirst European to set eyes on Mt. Dhaulagiri. When he calibrated \\nthe height of the mountain, he was amazed. Up until then, the \\nAndes in South America were considered the highest chain of \\nmountains in the world. The news of this new discovery left the \\nrest of the world incredulous.

In \\n1958, the Swiss were back and returned \\nyet again without reaching the summit. \\nThen it was the turn of the Austrians who \\ncould go no further than 7,802m. \\nIn 1960, another Swiss expedition arrived \\nin Nepal led by Max Eiselin and the team \\nincluded Kurt Diemberger and Norman \\nDyhrenfurth who went on to earn a \\nname for themselves.
